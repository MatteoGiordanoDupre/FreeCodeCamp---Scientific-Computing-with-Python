# FreeCodeCamp---Scientific-Computing-with-Python

This contains the assignments for the projects needed to complete FreeCodeCamp's 'Scientific Computing with Python' certification. 

The projects have multiple different solutions, I will upload the first one I can complete and update the files in case I find a solution that I consider more efficient/elegant.
